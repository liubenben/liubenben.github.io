About me
======
I am a Senior Researcher at LSCM R&D Center, The University of Hong Kong. Prior to that, I was a Advisory Researcher at Lenovo Machine Intelligence Center, Hong Kong. I received my BSc. degree in [Microelectronic](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/) from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), China, and Ph.D degree in [Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/) from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/).

I have over 15-year research and professional experience on VLSI design, FPGA/GPU-based design, and distributed system. My research interests include Cloud Computing, High Performance Computing, and Machine Learning. I'm interested in the theory and practice of designing high performance and scalable machine learning system.

I am a member of IEEE and member of Hong Kong Computer Society. I am the reviewer for top-tier journals and conferences including IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I, IEEE Transactions on Computers, Design Automation Conference.
